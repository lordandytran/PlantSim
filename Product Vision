Product Vision

-An application that uses a database to track and record the simulated growth of a plant thatâ€™s based on a real one.

-The database tracks the current weather location, the optimal growth of the plant, and the actual growth of the plant

-To forward growth the end user needs to water the plant based on the type.

-The goal is to teach the end user how to care for a certain real-life plant, while also taking into consideration the location, which is more of a dynamic factor.
