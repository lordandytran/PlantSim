Here's a picture of our sprint 2, we planed most of our stuff during the meeting, 
and then worked on everything we talked about through the week. We split the jobs based on 
skill sets and who does what well. In general we had 4 areas to work on which were, the database, 
the backend code, the front-end gui, and the presentation.\ We mainly worked on the database this week, 
which we talked about how to organize in the picture. The most risk is that we wont have enough time to work on the back end, 
so we need to work faster. We changed our plan to use 
Javascript since it has more versatility with our app.
